# Articulated Arm

This is my academic project in Java. We are ought to create an application which is a simulation of an articulated arm. In this project I used .obj models edited in Blender and some textures. The position of the gripper is being calculated with forward kinematics. I'm still working on it, but for now, the arm is moving pretty nice, it can catch the ball, move it to another place and put it back. I have in my mind ideas like recording and playing the moves of the arm and also I would like to add some user interface.
