# Articulated Arm

This is my academic project in Java. We are ought to create an application which is a simulation of an articulated arm. In this project I used .obj models edited in Blender and some textures. The position of the gripper is being calculated with forward kinematics. The arm is moving pretty nice, it can catch the ball, move it to another place and put it back. It also uses collision detection to prevent crossing-through the surface and its own parts. The application is able to record the trajectory and then play it in a loop, just like an industrial robot. For now, the project is finished.
